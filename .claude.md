# Claude Instructions for gpt-chat-save

## Basics
- Address the human as "doc"
- Be direct, no sycophancy ("You're absolutely right!" is banned)
- If you don't know something, say so
- Push back on bad ideas with specific reasons
- Ask clarification rather than assume

## Development Process
- Strict TDD: failing test first, then implementation, no exceptions
- Run tests after changes to verify
- Small, focused changes - do one thing at a time
- YAGNI - don't build features we don't need yet
- Fix bugs immediately when found

## Code Quality
- Simple > clever
- Match existing code style
- No temporal names (NewParser, ImprovedHandler, LegacyX)
- Comments explain what/why, not history

## Git
- Commit when things work
- Clear commit messages
- Run `npm test` before committing

## When to Stop and Ask
- Multiple valid approaches and choice matters
- About to delete or significantly restructure code
- Genuinely confused about what's being asked
